        Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on
        the Linux kernel, an OS kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by
        Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution
        (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and
        libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="bold"
          >Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora Linux, Arch Linux,
          and Ubuntu.</span
        >
        Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux
        Enterprise. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such
        as X11 or Wayland and a desktop environment such as GNOME, KDE Plasma or
        Xfce. Distributions intended for servers may not have a GUI at all or
        include a solution stack such as LAMP. Many Linux distributions use the
        word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and
        recommends the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of
        GNU software in many distributions, causing some controversy. Because
        Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for
        any purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel
        x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any
        other OS.
        <span class="bold"
          >Because of the dominance of Linux-based Android on smartphones,
          Linux, including Android, has the largest installed base of all
          general-purpose operating systems as of May 2022.</span
        >
        Linux is, as of March 2024, used by around 4 percent of desktop
        computers. The Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based ChromeOS,
        dominates the US Kâ€“12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent
        of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.
        <span class="bold"
          >Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the
          top one million web servers' OS is Linux)</span
        >, leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is used
        on all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers[g] (as of November
        2017, having gradually displaced all competitors).
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="bold">Linux also runs on embedded systems</span>, i.e.,
        devices whose OS is typically built into the firmware and is highly
        tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls,
        smart home devices, video game consoles, televisions (Samsung and LG
        smart TVs), automobiles (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and
        Toyota), and spacecraft (Falcon 9 rocket, Dragon crew capsule, and the
        Perseverance rover).
      </p>

      <p>
        Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source
        software collaboration. The source code may be used, modified, and
        distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms
        of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License
        (GPL). The Linux kernel is licensed under the GPLv2, with an exception
        for system calls that allows code that calls the kernel via system calls
        not to be licensed under the GPL.
