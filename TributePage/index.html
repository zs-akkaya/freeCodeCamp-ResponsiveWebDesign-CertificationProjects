          Linus Torvalds (born December 28, 1969, Helsinki, Finland) is a
          Finnish computer scientist who was the principal force behind the
          development of the Linux OS.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          At age 10 Torvalds began to dabble in computer programming on his
          grandfather’s Commodore VIC-20. In 1991 while a computer science
          student at the University of Helsinki (M.S., 1996), he purchased his
          first PC. He was not satisfied with the computer’s OS. His PC used
          MS-DOS (the disk operating system from Microsoft), but Torvalds
          preferred the UNIX OS he had used on the university’s computers.
          <span class="bold"
            >Consequently, he decided to create his own PC-based version of
            UNIX.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Months of determined programming work yielded the beginnings of an OS
          known as Linux. In 1991 Torvalds posted a message on the Internet to
          alert other PC users to his new system, made the software available as
          a free download, and, as was a common practice among software
          developers at the time, released the source code, which meant that
          anyone with knowledge of computer programming could modify Linux to
          suit their own purposes. Because of their access to the source code,
          many programmers helped Torvalds retool and refine the software, and
          <span class="bold"
            >by 1994 Linux kernel (original code) version 1.0 had been
            released.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Although Torvalds purposely made Linux open source,
          <span class="bold"
            >he would send abusive emails to those who made changes he disagreed
            with.</span
          >
          Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University, stated
          in a 2018 interview in The New Yorker that the emails may have
          contributed to the male-dominated Linux development community, as
          women may have found receiving the insulting messages to be more
          isolating than men may have found them. In 2018 Torvalds announced in
          a post to a Linux mailing list that he would step down as lead
          developer at Linux “to get help on how to behave differently.” He
          admitted that he had never been a “people person.”

          Operating Linux required a certain amount of technical acumen; it was
          not as easy to use as more popular operating systems, such as Windows,
          Apple’s Mac OS, or IBM OS/2. However,
          <span class="bold"
            >Linux evolved into a remarkably reliable, efficient system that
            rarely crashed.</span
          >
          Linux became popular in the late 1990s when competitors of Microsoft
          began taking the upstart OS seriously. Netscape Communications, Corel,
          Oracle, Intel, and other companies announced plans to support Linux as
          an inexpensive alternative to Windows.
          <span class="bold"
            >In addition to Linux being free, its source code can be viewed and
            freely modified by anyone, unlike in a proprietary OS.</span
          >
          This means that different language versions can be developed and
          deployed in markets that would be too small for the traditional
          companies. Also, many organizations and governments have expressed
          security reservations about using any kind of computer software
          containing code that cannot be viewed.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          <span class="bold"
            >Combined with Apache, an open-source Web server, Linux accounts for
            most of the servers used on the Internet.</span
          >
          Because it is open source, and thus modifiable for different uses,
          Linux is popular for systems as diverse as cell phones and
          supercomputers. Android, Google’s operating system for mobile devices,
          has at its core a modified Linux kernel, and Chrome OS, Google’s
          operating system, which uses the Chrome browser, is also Linux-based.
          The addition of user-friendly desktop environments, office suites,
          browsers, and even games helped to increase Linux’s popularity and
          make it more suitable for home and office desktops.

          In 1997 Torvalds took a position with Transmeta, a microprocessor
          manufacturer, and relocated to California. Six years later he left the
          company to work as a project coordinator under the auspices of the
          Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), a consortium created by such
          high-tech companies as IBM, Intel, and Siemens to promote Linux
          development. In 2007 OSDL merged with the Free Standards Group to form
          the Linux Foundation. In 2012 Torvalds was awarded the Millennium
          Technology Prize by the foundation Technology Academy Finland.
