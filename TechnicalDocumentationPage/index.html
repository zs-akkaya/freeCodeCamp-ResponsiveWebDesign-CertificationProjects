            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
            documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
            content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
            technologies such as CSS and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
            storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
            describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for its appearance.
          </p>

            <span class="bold"
              >HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.</span
            >
            With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive
            forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means
            to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
            text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other
            items.
            <span class="bold"
              >HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle
              brackets.</span
            >
            Tags such as &ltimg&gt and &ltinput&gt directly introduce content
            into the page. Other tags such as &ltp&gt surround and provide
            information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
            Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
            content of the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold"
              >HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
              JS, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
              inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</span
            >
            The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML
            and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use
            of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML,
            known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using
            the &ltcanvas> element, together with JavaScript.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
            markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
            SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
            Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

          <p>
            <span class="bold"
              >CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
              presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.</span
            >
            This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content
            can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more
            flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
            characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
            specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
            complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
            .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
            pages that share the file and its formatting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
            determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of
            a property match a particular element. This cascading priority
            scheme is predictable.

            JavaScript (JS) is a programming language and core technology of the
            Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the
            client side for webpage behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the
            client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a
            variety of apps.
            <span class="bold"

          <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
            that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
            prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
            programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
            for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
            structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
          </p>
          <p>
            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O),
            such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice,
            the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for
            I/O.

              Web development is the work involved in developing a website for
              the Internet or an intranet (a private network). Web development
              can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
              text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and
              social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to
              which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
              engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
              client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
              configuration, and e-commerce development.<span class="bold"
                >Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to
                make content changes easier and available with basic technical
                skills.</span
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can
              consist of hundreds of Web developers and follow standard methods
              like Agile methodologies. Web development may be a collaborative
              effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated
              department.
              <span class="bold"
                >There are three kinds of Web developer specialization:
                front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer.</span
              >
              Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that
              run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the
              servers. Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has
              boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

              <span class="bold">Origin/ Web 1.0</span> Tim Berners-Lee created
              the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN. The primary goal in the
              development of the Web was to fulfill the automated
              information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with
              institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML
              was developed in 1993. Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm
              wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount
              of information. Core protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, HTML and URI.

            <li>
              <span class="bold">Web 2.0</span>, a term popularised by Dale
              Dougherty, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004
              conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage,
              emphasizing interactivity. Web 2.0 introduced increased user
              engagement and communication. It evolved from the static,
              read-only nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for
              engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a
              user-focused, read-write online network. In the realm of Web 2.0
              environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages
              sharing activities such as creating music, files, images, and
              movies. The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the
              "backbone of the internet," using standardized XML tags to
              authorize information flow from independent platforms and online
              databases.

              <span class="bold">Web 3.0</span>, considered the third and
              current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept
              envisions a complete redesign of the web. Key features include the
              integration of metadata, precise information delivery, and
              improved user experiences based on preferences, history, and
              interests. Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized
              database, providing more functionality than traditional search
              engines. Users can customize navigation based on their
              preferences, and the core ideas involve identifying data sources,
              connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles. This
              version is sometimes also known as Semantic Web.
